  <p><strong>“Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure…than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory
      nor defeat” – Theodore Roosevelt</strong></p>
  <p>With this as my ethos, I have, and still continue to strive to grow into a strong young woman who does all things (deemed great or small) with determination and zeal, knowing that everything can be a learning experience for greater things.</p>
  <p>Today I have grown up to become a dynamic, expressive, determined and enthusiastic individual who has a huge urge to stamp my unique thumbprint on anything and everything that comes my way, always looking to use my creative flare to solve
    problems with a fresh perspective. My CV marks what I have done up until now, but my focus is on the present. Potential is greatness in seed form. I know that I have potential, and I’m looking to hone that potential by planting in the right soil,
    to blossom and be fruitful.</p>
